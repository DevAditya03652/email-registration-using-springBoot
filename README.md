# email-registration-using-springBoot
This is a simple email registration and verification (only backend) that I built. I have used Java for developing this project. After building this one, I came to know about the way Spring Boot simplifies things when 
it comes to developing industry-grade applications in Java. For database, I used PostgreSQL which is also cool in itself. I see this project as a testament to my new journey in the world of backend development in Java. 
I hope you like the simplicity and clarity of the code that I have written. If there are any shortcomings, I am open to suggestions.
